- version 0.34
- change the distorttest function in the gets package
- change the distorttestboot function in the gets package
- check distorttestboot if it does it on all variables and if not create argument for not testing all coefficients
- check behaviour of distorttest when ar = 1 in isat (the y.index then starts from 2)

- check with TS parametric whether there is an intercept

To consider: 
- Store the bootstrap output and the isat models run on the bootstrap and separate the testing from this to a different script. 
Benefit: if we do another analysis measure, we don't have to re-estimate all isat objects



change non-param TS with AR hard coded when cleaning
